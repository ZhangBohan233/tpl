#### Build 1012 ####
2019/12/25

* New syntax for struct attr:
    * struct.attr for struct self
    * struct_ptr..attr for struct pointer

#### Build 1011 ####
2019/12/24

* Modified pointer system:
    * Types with '*' now stores true pointer, which can be passes between functions
* Supports for null statement
* Added compile time functions:
    * sizeof
* Struct
* VM optimization:
    * Uses 'int_fast64_t' instead of 'int64_t'
* Known bugs:
    * Struct attr not working

#### Build 1010 ####
2019/12/24

* Enable level 1 compile time optimize:
    * Merge assignment and binary operation/function call
* Implemented heap memory management:
    * malloc, free

#### Build 1009 ####
2019/12/23

* Added support for operation-assignment operators:
    * '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '%='
* VM optimization:
    * Binary operation uses less registers

#### Build 1008 ####
2019/12/23

* Added support for 'break' and 'continue'

#### Build 1007 ####
2019/12/22

* Support of for loop
* Optimized while loop
* Tpa (Trash program assembly) compiler

#### Build 1006 ####
2019/12/21

* VM performance optimization
    * Replaced simple functions by macros
    * Register

#### Build 1005 ####
2019/12/21

* Added binary operators:
    * &&, ||, >=, <=

#### Build 1004 ####
2019/12/21

* Compiler in Python, Virtual machine in C
* Dramatically improved performance
* Re-implemented everything: currently finished:
    * Variable assignment and retrievement
    * Basic arithmetic of int
    * Function call
    * Types: int, char, boolean
    * If-else statement
    * Simple pointer operation
    * One-dimensional indexing
    * While loop

#### Build 1002 ####

* Memory updates:
    * Re-implemented the available memory pool using a heap. Improved memory fragment management but reduced speed
* Added more memory related built-in functions
* Bug fixes:
    * Fixed that every 'null' occupied 8 bytes

#### Build 1001 ####

* Created TPL: Trash Programming Language
